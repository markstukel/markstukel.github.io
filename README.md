### About Me
I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Bond Lab](https://www.bondlab.org/) in the UC Davis Entomology & Nematology department and the [Forthman Lab](https://mforthman.weebly.com/) at the California Department of Food and Agriculture. My research interests are in phylogenomics, systematics, hybridization, and biogeography, with a special interest in insects of the order Hemiptera.
